# TephraMatch
Matlab code for aligning age-depth models for sediment cores with synchronous layers (often tephra)

Code is designed to take the ensembles of age-depth model iterations from two sites, and identify the iterations that assign the same age (within an uncertainty) to prescribed depths, which should be synchronous at both sites. This code is presented with the following manuscript, please cite if you use this code:
